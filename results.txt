It was about being their own masters and defying the authorities in the biggest way possible. And smoking
hash right next to the boarding school was pretty much the worst you could do. So they passed the pipe
around and mocked the teachers, trying to outdo each other, imagining what they would do to them if they could.

She too was laughing like a lunatic. This shit was some of the best they'd ever had. "I'm telling the
headmaster", the boy screamed at them, noticing too late how quickly the older students' laughter
fell silent. A sprightly boy who was used to taunting others, he could have easily outrun them,
given how loaded they were, but the thicket was overgrown and the danger he'd put them in too great
for them to let that happen.

Or we can hold you underwater in the stream, or we can let you go and give you the twenty thousand

What do you say, you little shit? The boy didn't respond. Ditlev went and stood right over him, curious.
Searching the little bastard's reaction fascinated him.
